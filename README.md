# MAXI Beckhoff TwinCAT3 project

PLC project files for MAXI endstation.

The PLC has a few simple control system tasks, such as digital I/O and analog-digital conversion.
For the most part, we only need to make the relevant in- and outputs available as process variables.
The variables are accessed from tango via (https://github.com/stlehmann/pyads/tree/master)[pyads]
